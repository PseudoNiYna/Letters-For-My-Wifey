    "Baby ko, you don’t have to earn my love,you already have it. Hindi mo kailangan magbago or maging perfect. I fell in love with you, just the way you are. Always remember that, ha?",

    "Hi love ko,\nMiss mo na ako, no? 😅 Kasi ako, miss na miss na rin kita. Ang tahimik ng gabi pag wala ka. I miss your voice, your kulit, even the way you make fun of me. Come back soon, ha? My world’s softer when you’re here. 🤍",
    "Babycakes,\nEvery time I miss you, I remind myself how lucky I am that someone like you even exists in my life. Distance lang to, baby. My heart’s still beside you, steady, faithful, and waiting for the next hug. 💌",
    "Wifey,\nI wish I could teleport just to see that smile again. Sobrang nakakapanibago kapag wala ka. Pero kahit malayo ka, you’re still my peace. You’re the home I carry wherever I go. 🏡❤️",
    "Mahal ko,\nIt’s funny how missing you feels both sweet and painful. Sweet kasi it reminds me how much I love you, painful kasi gusto na kitang yakapin. Pero okay lang, love, konting tiis pa, makikita rin kita ulit. 💞",
    "Asawa ko,\nThe bed feels too big without you. Wala yung “baby, tulog na tayo” voice mo, and I miss it so much. Pero kahit wala ka sa tabi ko, I still feel your love wrapping around me like a blanket. 🌙",
    "Baby,\nWhen I miss you too much, I close my eyes and imagine your laugh. Works every time. You make everything feel lighter, even through memories. Can’t wait to make new ones with you soon. 💕",
    "Yna,\nYou’re the thought that keeps sneaking into every quiet moment. Kahit busy ako, bigla ka pa ring pumapasok sa isip ko. I guess that’s what love does, it fills every space, even when you’re miles away. 🌤️",
    "Love ko,\nDo you know what I miss most? Yung simplicity ng mga moments natin, yung tahimik lang pero ramdam ko yung connection natin. I’d trade a hundred perfect days for one ordinary day with you. 🤍",
    "Wifey,\nDistance isn’t really distance when our hearts are this close. I know you miss me, and I miss you too, sobra. Pero let’s hold on, ha? We’ve got something worth waiting for. 💫",
    "Babycakes ko,\nOne day, we won’t have to miss each other like this. I’ll be there,beside you, not in your messages. But until that day, remember this: every second we’re apart just means I’ll love you even louder when we meet again. 💖"

    "Babycakes ko,\nIf I could take back the words or actions that hurt you, I would, a hundred times over. You mean so much to me, baby. I don’t want a single thing to break what we have. Please don’t forget that I love you more than my pride. 💌",
    "Mahal ko,\nOkay lang magalit ka, you have every right. Pero sana kahit konti, maramdaman mong sincere ako sa sorry ko. I don’t want us to sleep angry, baby. I just want us to fix this, slowly, gently, together. 💞",
    "Love ko,\nI know you’re upset, and I won’t force you to talk yet. Just know na kahit galit ka, ikaw pa rin iniisip ko. I still care, still love you, still rooting for your smile to come back soon. I miss you already. 🥺",
    "Asawa ko,\nHindi ako perfect, pero I’ll never stop trying to be better for you. I don’t want to lose the peace we built just because of one mistake. You’re worth every effort, baby. And I’ll keep proving that. 💗",
    "Baby,\nI’m sorry if I made you feel unappreciated. You don’t deserve that. You’re my safe place, and I hate knowing I hurt you. Please let me make it right, not just with words, but with how I’ll treat you after this. 🌧️",
    "Yna,\nYou can stay mad for now, I understand. But even in your silence, I’ll still be here, waiting patiently. Kasi mahal kita, and no amount of tampo will change that. I just hope you still know that I’m yours, always. 🤍",
    "Babycakes,\nYou being mad at me hurts, pero mas masakit isipin na I caused it. I’m sorry, love. For real. I’ll learn, promise. Just please don’t forget how much I adore you, even when you give me that deadma look. 😅❤️",
    "Mahal ko,\nIf words could hug, I’d send you a thousand right now. Pero since sorry lang meron ako, I’ll say it again: I’m sorry, baby. I love you. I’ll wait for your okay na ako kahit gaano katagal.",
    "Wifey,\nI know sometimes I say the wrong things or act without thinking, but please never doubt my love for you. I might mess up, but I’ll always come back, not because I have to, but because I can’t stand a day without you. 💞"
