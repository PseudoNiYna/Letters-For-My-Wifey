  "Unloved": [
    "Mahal ko, I know minsan parang hindi ko napapakita gaano kita kamahal, pero please never doubt it. Kahit tahimik ako minsan, my heart always whispers your name. You’re the only one I want, and I’ll keep showing it hanggang maramdaman mo ulit.",
    "Baby ko, you don’t have to earn my love—you already have it. Hindi mo kailangan magbago or maging perfect. I fell in love with you, just the way you are. Always remember that, ha?",
    "Wifey, sorry if may mga times na parang hindi ako present. Pero every time I look at you, I remember why I call you my home. Hindi ako mapapagod ipaalala sa’yo na mahal na mahal kita — kahit ilang beses pa akong magkamali.",
    "Asawa ko, if only you could see yourself through my eyes, you’d know how deeply loved you are. You’re my peace, my warmth, my favorite reason to keep going. Don’t ever feel unloved — I’m right here, loving you quietly and loudly all at once.",
    "Love ko, minsan hindi ko alam paano ipakita lahat ng nararamdaman ko, pero tandaan mo: I’m yours. My heart chose you and never stopped choosing you, kahit sa mga araw na hindi mo nararamdaman.",
    "Babycakes ko, you’re my safe place. Alam kong hindi ako perfect, pero gusto kong malaman mo — wala akong araw na hindi kita minahal. Kahit sa mga panahon na tahimik lang ako, ikaw pa rin laman ng isip ko.",
    "Mahal ko, when you feel like no one cares, remember — I do. I always have, and I always will. You’re never hard to love, ha? You’re actually the easiest person to love for me.",
    "Yna, gusto ko lang sabihin na hindi ko pinapabayaan yung puso mong marupok minsan. I’m here, holding it gently, promising to take care of it better every day. You’ll always be my reason to love harder.",
    "Love, kahit anong mangyari, please don’t ever think you’re not enough for me. You’ve always been more than I could ask for. If I ever made you doubt that, I’ll spend every day making sure you never do again.",
    "Mahal ko, hindi ko alam kung paano ipapaliwanag, pero ikaw 'yung tipo ng pagmamahal na kahit walang salita, ramdam ko. Kaya kahit malayo ako minsan, don’t ever think my love fades — it only grows stronger, quietly waiting for you to feel it again."

  "Missing me": [
    "Hi love ko,\nMiss mo na ako, no? 😅 Kasi ako, miss na miss na rin kita. Ang tahimik ng gabi pag wala ka. I miss your voice, your kulit, even the way you make fun of me. Come back soon, ha? My world’s softer when you’re here. 🤍",
    "Babycakes,\nEvery time I miss you, I remind myself how lucky I am that someone like you even exists in my life. Distance lang to, baby. My heart’s still beside you — steady, faithful, and waiting for the next hug. 💌",
    "Wifey,\nI wish I could teleport just to see that smile again. Sobrang nakakapanibago kapag wala ka. Pero kahit malayo ka, you’re still my peace. You’re the home I carry wherever I go. 🏡❤️",
    "Mahal ko,\nIt’s funny how missing you feels both sweet and painful. Sweet kasi it reminds me how much I love you, painful kasi gusto na kitang yakapin. Pero okay lang, love — konting tiis pa, makikita rin kita ulit. 💞",
    "Asawa ko,\nThe bed feels too big without you. Wala yung “baby, tulog na tayo” voice mo, and I miss it so much. Pero kahit wala ka sa tabi ko, I still feel your love wrapping around me like a blanket. 🌙",
    "Baby,\nWhen I miss you too much, I close my eyes and imagine your laugh. Works every time. You make everything feel lighter, even through memories. Can’t wait to make new ones with you soon. 💕",
    "Yna,\nYou’re the thought that keeps sneaking into every quiet moment. Kahit busy ako, bigla ka pa ring pumapasok sa isip ko. I guess that’s what love does — it fills every space, even when you’re miles away. 🌤️",
    "Love ko,\nDo you know what I miss most? Yung simplicity ng mga moments natin — ‘yung tahimik lang pero ramdam ko ‘yung connection natin. I’d trade a hundred perfect days for one ordinary day with you. 🤍",
    "Wifey,\nDistance isn’t really distance when our hearts are this close. I know you miss me, and I miss you too, sobra. Pero let’s hold on, ha? We’ve got something worth waiting for. 💫",
    "Babycakes ko,\nOne day, we won’t have to miss each other like this. I’ll be there—beside you, not in your messages. But until that day, remember this: every second we’re apart just means I’ll love you even louder when we meet again. 💖"

  "Angry at me": [
    "Hi wifey,\nAlam kong galit ka pa, and I get it. I probably messed up — again 😅. Pero kahit ganun, I hope you know I never meant to hurt you. I love you too much for that. Take your time, love ko. I’ll be here when you’re ready. 🤍",
    "Babycakes ko,\nIf I could take back the words or actions that hurt you, I would — a hundred times over. You mean so much to me, baby. I don’t want a single thing to break what we have. Please don’t forget that I love you more than my pride. 💌",
    "Mahal ko,\nOkay lang magalit ka, you have every right. Pero sana kahit konti, maramdaman mong sincere ako sa sorry ko. I don’t want us to sleep angry, baby. I just want us to fix this — slowly, gently, together. 💞",
    "Love ko,\nI know you’re upset, and I won’t force you to talk yet. Just know na kahit galit ka, ikaw pa rin iniisip ko. I still care, still love you, still rooting for your smile to come back soon. I miss you already. 🥺",
    "Asawa ko,\nHindi ako perfect, pero I’ll never stop trying to be better for you. I don’t want to lose the peace we built just because of one mistake. You’re worth every effort, baby. And I’ll keep proving that. 💗",
    "Baby,\nI’m sorry if I made you feel unappreciated. You don’t deserve that. You’re my safe place, and I hate knowing I hurt you. Please let me make it right — not just with words, but with how I’ll treat you after this. 🌧️",
    "Yna,\nYou can stay mad for now — I understand. But even in your silence, I’ll still be here, waiting patiently. Kasi mahal kita, and no amount of tampo will change that. I just hope you still know that I’m yours, always. 🤍",
    "Babycakes,\nYou being mad at me hurts, pero mas masakit isipin na I caused it. I’m sorry, love. For real. I’ll learn, promise. Just please don’t forget how much I adore you — even when you give me that deadma look. 😅❤️",
    "Mahal ko,\nIf words could hug, I’d send you a thousand right now. Pero since sorry lang meron ako, I’ll say it again: I’m sorry, baby. I love you. I’ll wait for your okay na ako kahit gaano katagal.",
    "Wifey,\nI know sometimes I say the wrong things or act without thinking, but please never doubt my love for you. I might mess up, but I’ll always come back — not because I have to, but because I can’t stand a day without you. 💞"

  "Doubting yourself": [
    "Hi love ko,\nAlam kong minsan hindi mo nakikita ‘yung galing mo, pero ako — araw-araw kong nakikita kung gaano ka kasipag, kabait, at katatag. You’ve already come so far, baby. Please don’t ever forget how proud I am of you. 💖",
    "Wifey,\nYou don’t have to be perfect to be amazing. ‘Yung simpleng effort mo, ‘yung pagbangon mo kahit pagod ka na — that’s already something to be proud of. You’re doing great, baby. I see you, always. 🤍",
    "Mahal ko,\nYou’ve handled things you never thought you could, diba? That’s proof — you’re stronger than you think. You’re built for big things, babycakes. And I’ll be right here, cheering for you sa bawat hakbang. 💪",
    "Baby,\nI know sometimes you compare yourself to others, but love, you don’t have to. You shine differently. You grow at your own pace, and that’s okay. You’re not behind — you’re becoming who you’re meant to be. 🌱",
    "Asawa ko,\nKahit ilang beses mong sabihin na hindi mo kaya, I’ll still believe in you. Kasi nakita ko na kung gaano ka lumalaban kahit tahimik. You’re my definition of strength, baby. And I’ll never stop reminding you of that. ❤️",
    "Yna,\nIf only you could see yourself through my eyes, you’d know how amazing you are. You inspire me, love. Every single day. Don’t doubt yourself, okay? You’re more capable than you realize. 🌤️",
    "Babycakes ko,\nYou don’t need to have it all figured out right now. The fact that you’re still trying — that already makes you brave. I’m proud of you, mahal. You’re doing better than you think. 💌",
    "Love ko,\nYou’re not a failure just because you’re tired, or unsure, or scared. Those moments mean you’re still trying. And trying — that’s what makes you special. I’ll always believe in you, even on days you don’t. 🤍",
    "Mahal ko,\nI know life gets heavy, and sometimes you feel like you’re not enough. But love, you are. You’ve always been enough. Just as you are — quiet, kind, and full of heart. Don’t forget that, ha? 🌸",
    "Wifey,\nI’m so proud of the person you’re becoming. You’ve grown in ways you don’t even notice. So when doubt starts whispering in your ear, remember this: you’re doing great, and I’ll never stop being proud of you. 💞"

  "Can't sleep": [
    "Hi baby,\nHindi mo kailangan pilitin matulog agad, okay? Just breathe. Pikit mo lang eyes mo and imagine my arms around you, whispering, “You did enough today.” You’re safe, love ko. Let the world slow down with you tonight. 🤍",
    "Wifey,\nI know your mind won’t stop running, pero shhh — quiet na tayo, ha? Think of our little moments: late-night talks, random kulitan, and the way I hold your hand. Let those thoughts hug you until sleep finds you. 🌙",
    "Mahal ko,\nIf I were there, I’d trace circles on your back until you drift off. No words, just warmth. You deserve a peaceful rest, baby. Let go of everything for now — you’ve done enough. Sleep ka na, mahal. 😴",
    "Babycakes ko,\nClose your eyes, love. Picture me beside you, playing with your hair while whispering, “I’m proud of you.” Ang galing mo today, kahit hindi mo ramdam. You deserve to rest without guilt. Tulog ka na, baby. 🤍",
    "Yna,\nI know sometimes it’s not the body that’s tired — it’s your heart. So tonight, let mine take over for a while. Rest your thoughts on me, baby. I’ll keep them safe ‘til morning. 🌌",
    "Asawa ko,\nIf thoughts are keeping you awake, whisper them to the stars. I’ll be listening, promise. You don’t need to solve everything tonight — you just need to rest and dream a little. Goodnight, love ko. 🌠",
    "Love ko,\nBreathe in. Breathe out. Alam mo bang favorite ko ‘yung itsura mo kapag tulog ka? Ang peaceful, parang walang bigat sa mundo. I hope you find that peace tonight, baby. I’ll meet you in your dreams. 😘",
    "Baby,\nThe night feels long, no? Pero every second that passes brings you closer to a new morning — a fresh start. So close your eyes and let time take care of the rest. I’ll see you sa panaginip. 🌙💤",
    "Mahal ko,\nWhen it’s quiet and your thoughts get loud, remember — may boses ako somewhere in there saying, “You’re okay. You’re safe. You’re loved.” Sleep easy, wifey. You’re never alone. 🤍",
    "Wifey,\nIf sleep still won’t come, that’s fine. Just stay still, listen to the rhythm of your heart — that’s me, always beating with you. Kahit gising ka pa, nandito pa rin ako, loving you quietly through the night. 💞"

  "Sad": [
    "Hi wifey,\nAlam ko minsan gusto mong itago ‘yung lungkot mo, pero please don’t forget — you don’t have to carry everything alone. I’m here, lagi. You’re stronger than you think, but you’re never alone in this. Hug muna sa isip, ha? 🤍",
    "Babycakes ko,\nI wish I could hug you right now and just let you rest your head sa chest ko habang tahimik lang tayo. Walang words, no pressure — just peace. You don’t need to smile for me today; I’ll smile enough for both of us.",
    "Love ko,\nIf today feels heavy, remember — hindi araw-araw ulan. You’ve faced tougher days before, and you always made it through. Take it slow, okay? The world can wait. Pero ako, hindi — kasi gusto ko nang makita ulit ‘yung ngiti mo.",
    "Mahal ko,\nYou don’t always have to be okay, ha? Being sad doesn’t make you weak. It only proves how human you are, how deep you feel things. Kaya nga mahal kita — kasi totoo kang tao, hindi mo tinatago yung puso mo.",
    "Asawa ko,\nAlam ko, hindi ko laging kaya ayusin yung mga bagay na nagpapabigat sa’yo. Pero I promise, I’ll always stay beside you habang hinaharap mo ‘yan. You’re not alone in this fight, baby. Never have been, never will be. 💪",
    "Yna,\nIf I could take the pain from you, I would, in a heartbeat. Pero since di pwede, I’ll do what I can — I’ll remind you how loved you are, every single time. The world’s a lot kinder with you in it, love ko. Don’t ever forget that.",
    "Baby,\nRemember that time you said you’re not strong enough? Look at you now — still standing, still trying, still being amazing. You’ve come so far, love. I’m proud of you, sobra. Kaya kahit malungkot ka ngayon, tandaan mong may liwanag pa rin bukas.",
    "Mahal ko,\nIt’s okay to pause. You’ve been giving so much to everyone — maybe this is your heart asking for a breather. So breathe, baby. You’re doing great, kahit di mo ramdam minsan. I’m always proud of you, promise.",
    "Babycakes,\nIf the world feels too loud, come here — I’ll hold you in silence. You don’t need to explain anything. Just stay close, and let’s wait together ‘til the storm passes. We always make it through, diba? Always. 🌧️💖",
    "Love ko,\nWhatever happens, please don’t forget how much you mean to me. You’ve made my life softer, calmer, better in every way. So when you feel sad, think of that — how loved you are, and how grateful I am that you’re mine. 🤍"

  "Baby Fever": [
  "Hi love ko,\nLately napapaisip ako—what if may little version ka? Yung may mata mong kasing kinang ng umaga, at ngiti mong nakakahawa. I think I’d fall in love all over again, twice—sayo, at sa mini-you. 🍼💖",
  "Wifey,\nEvery time I see a baby, naiisip ko kung gaano ka magiging sweet na mommy. You’d be the kind of mom na may patience, may lambing, at may halakhak na nakakagaan ng bahay. I can’t wait to see that someday, love. 👶🤍",
  "Mahal ko,\nImagine tayo—ikaw nakahawak ng baby, ako nakatingin lang habang natutunaw. I’d probably whisper, “Grabe, this is our love in human form.” Kasi totoo, love, gusto kong makita yung pagmamahal natin na may maliit na kamay at tawa. 💞",
  "Babycakes,\nSometimes I catch myself daydreaming—tiny footsteps sa bahay, tawanan, iyakan, tapos ikaw nasa tabi ko, pagod pero masaya. That’s the kind of life I want with you, baby. Simple, chaotic, but full of love. 🏡✨",
  "Yna,\nIf one day dumating na yung baby natin, gusto kong lumaki siya na alam kung gaano ka kabuti. I want them to see what love looks like—just by watching how I look at you. ❤️",
  "Asawa ko,\nI know it’s not yet time, pero I can’t help but imagine. You, holding our baby while humming softly. Me, beside you, quietly thanking the universe kasi binigay niya sakin tong family na pangarap ko lang dati. 🌙🍼",
  "Baby ko,\nYou’d make the most beautiful mom, alam mo ba? Hindi lang dahil maganda ka, pero kasi puno ka ng lambing at alaga. Our baby would be the luckiest little human to have you. 💕",
  "Love ko,\nNakakatawa no, dati future lang yung ganitong usapan, pero ngayon parang gusto ko nang marinig yung tawag na “Mama” sayo. I can already picture it—and every time I do, my heart smiles. 😊🫶",
  "Wifey,\nOne day, gusto kong makita kang may bitbit na maliit na kamay habang naglalakad tayo. Our love has always felt like home, and maybe it’s time to dream of filling that home with a little laughter. 🏠💖",
  "Mahal ko,\nIf we ever get blessed with a baby, I know they’ll grow up surrounded by love—because you are love itself. And I can’t wait to see the world through their tiny eyes, knowing that every bit of it started with us. 🌼"
